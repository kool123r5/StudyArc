                Our goal is to improve student life by providing a place where students can share resources and collaborate with each other.
                We want to try to help students like ourselves, enhance their learning capabilities for things such as homework, 
                projects or even for general knowledge. We realised that it is hard to find a place where you can write notes, read textbooks, pdfâ€™s, 
                and ppts, so we made this website which allows you to type up notes while going through a textbook all in one website, 
               making it much easier to study and find notes before your exams.
